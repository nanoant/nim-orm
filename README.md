Object-relational mapping for Nim
---------------------------------

[nim]: http://nim-lang.org

This is ORM module for [Nim][nim] language and its `db_sqlite`, `db_mysql` and
`db_postgres` standard database modules.

Importing `orm` requires one of `sqlite`, `mysql` or `postgres` defines, since
ORM module imports on of the databases.

### Features

1. Turning Nim expressions into SQL syntax at compile time
2. Iterating through model objects based on given `where(...)`
3. **NYI** Storing model object changes via `save()`

### Usage

1. Importing module and selecting database interface

   ~~~nim
   import orm_sqlite #<- for interfacing with sqlite
   # create empty in memory database
   Model.open("", "", "", "")
   Model.exec("CREATE TABLE User(name varchar(32), password varchar(32))", [])
   Model.exec("INSERT INTO User VALUES('joe', '123')", [])
   Model.exec("INSERT INTO User VALUES('ann', 'abc')", [])
   ~~~

2. Iterating through model objects based on given expression

   ~~~nim
   var password = "abc"
   var name = "ann"
   
   # expected: joe, ann
   for user in User.where((@password == "123" or @password == password) and
                          (@name == "joe" or @name == name)):
     echo user.name

   # expected: joe, ann
   for user in User:
     echo user.name

   ~~~

### Discussion

Nim has powerful AST rewriting capabilities via compile-time macros, this leads
us to amazing optimizations while keeping application code nice, clean & at
higher level.

Currently the module translates expressions into SQL calls at compile time, eg.:

~~~nim
var password = "abc"
var name = "ann"

for user in User.where((@password == "123" or @password == password) and
                       (@name == "joe" or @name == name)):
~~~

is translated to:

~~~nim
for user in User.fetch("SELECT `name`, `password` FROM `User` where
                        (`User`.`password` = '123' OR `User`.`password` = ?) AND
                        (`User`.`name` = 'joe' OR `User`.`name` = ?)",
                       password, name):
~~~

add macro items

~~~nim

for user in User:
~~~

is translated to:

~~~nim
for user in User.fetch("SELECT `name`, `password` FROM `User`"):
~~~

[activemodel]: https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activemodel

Comparing to other solutions such as [ActiveModel][activemodel] from
[Ruby][ruby] where such translation is done at runtime level, we got great
performance boost and syntax error diagnostics already there at compile-time.
